# Body-Dynamics
### Task 1
i) Construct a 3-body system: sun, earth, moon with realistic textures.

ii) Animation of the motion of moon and earth according to their real orbits for the next 500 years in fast forward. 

iii) Create control system for navigation in the virtual space environment.

### Task 2
iv) Simulation of the motion of the 3 bodies using their real parameters (mass, distances, initial conditions).

v) Simulation of the motion of earth in case of a collision with a random asteroid.

vi) Add all the planets in the simulation.
